								<div class="name">Coach Dallin Frampton</div>
								As a 24 year old resident of Holladay, Utah, Dallin, and his beautiful wife, Carlyn, are the Owners of CrossFit SpearHead. Dallin is an avid runner, mountain biker, rock climber, triathlete, mountaineer, skier, surfer and adventurer. He has participated in 2 marathons and a handful of triathlons, 2 of which he got 1st and 2nd place in his age group. He has also run the Wasatch Back relay four different times, competed in 12 half marathons and ridden the White rim trail 4 different times, 3 of the attempts were under 16 hours. When he was training to tryout for the USA amateur triathlon team in 2009, Dallin was introduced to CrossFit and began coaching athletes just 18 months later. Not only does he enjoy the competent and measurable aspect of CrossFit, but Dallin also has an amazing passion for his athletes and the completion of their goals through fitness, nutrition and life.<br><br>

								After graduating in 2008, he raised over $10,000 to build a school in the village of Dzivani, just outside of Mombasa, Kenya. After he received funding from CrossFit Headquarters to build another school, Coach Greg Glassman brought him on board to work for CrossFit HQ staff and Dallin is now Project Lead on this effort to build schools, water cisterns, desks and the like in rural Kenya, and also oversees all of the philanthropic work CrossFit HQ takes part in. Besides letting his adrenaline lead him through life, he also loves music and has been playing guitar for over 9 years.<br><br>

								During the Fall months of 2011, Dallin was able to meet the woman of his dreams and in June 2013, he was married to his beautiful and amazing bride, Carlyn Frampton, and they now are able to run a gym full of passionate, spirited people that they love coaching every single day. Dallin is so grateful to have such a hard-working and spirited elite-athlete like Carlyn supporting him in everything he does, especially when it comes to running the gym!

								<div class="name">Coach Sean Crotty</div>
								Greetings Spearheaders! My name is Sean Fergus Crotty. I come from strong Irish lineage. I reign from the "Heart of it all" or what some people call Ohio. I also come from a very close family consisting of 2 brothers and 1 sister. two of my siblings have already migrated out this way towards the mountains and we are working on the third. I have two wonderful parents who provide me unconditional support. I have a background primarily working in the Non-Profit sector which ultimately led me to serve in the Peace Corps in Southeast Asia as a medical volunteer and program advisor for the (CDC) Center for Disease Control. I am currently on track to start P.A. school in the Fall and specialize in Pediatric Care/Oncology. On top of the this life changing experience, I also discovered a passion for CrossFit while living in the Capitol of Cambodia. A friend of mine opened up the first box in Cambodia and once I started diving into the CrossFit methodology I was hooked. I have had a number of surgeries due to sports and "adrenaline loving" hobbies. I was told that Olympic weightlifting and CrossFit was out of the question. I was told my back couldn't take any strain outside of biking. Ironically, CrossFit movements have led me to be pain free in my back for the first time in 7 years! I owe this to not only the wonderful programming but also the community that CrossFit builds. We don't only build stronger individuals literally and figuratively but we also build strong communities. CrossFit is a very poetic thing and is much more than lifting heavy objects and pulling our chins over bars.<br><br>

								We connect individuals, we push our thresholds, we set new boundaries, we create self esteem, we laugh, we cry, we laugh some more. CrossFit methodology set a precedent for other obstacles in our lives. It helps us push boundaries. It allows us to laugh at ourselves and also shock ourselves. Going through these changes with athletes is the reason I wanted to become a CrossFit coach. There is a certain level of vulnerability and humility that you have to have when you walk in the doors of a box. These levels of emotion open us up to build friendship. I have seen lives changed through CrossFit in very short periods of time, mine included. I believe in perfect form, pushing your boundaries, setting high targets, eating clean, not taking yourself too seriously, and living life with a smile.<br><br>

								In my free time, I enjoy telemark skiing, alpine climbing, biking, cooking, reading anything I can get my hands on, philanthropy, guitar, cooking, and making jokes that only a few people laugh at (Dallin included).

								After finishing up collegiate swimming career as a distance swimmer for the University of Utah, I went to local globo gym sporadically to try and stay in shape.  In the summer of 2012, my friend and I signed up for the Spartan race and nearly died, he from the distance running me from the strength challenges. Then I decided I needed to start taking my health and fitness more seriously. I joined, at the time, CrossFit Mount Olympus, now, CrossFit East Mill Creek where I quickly fell in love with CrossFit. I then received my CrossFit Level 1 in October 2012 and began coaching. Soon thereafter I started signing up for other certifications to improve my abilities as a coach. I got my Kids (Sept 2013), Strongman (July 2014), Powerlifting (Sept 2014), Level 2 (November 2014), and Weightlifting (January 2015) Certifications. I have implemented the CrossFit Kids methodology into my full-time work as a PE teacher and swim coach at Judge Memorial and J.E. Cosgriff where children from ages 3-18 enjoy a constantly varied, functional physical education class.<br><br>

								My fitness goals: 300+ lb back squat, double body weight deadlift, 5 unbroken ring muscle ups, body weight snatch, 200+ lb clean and jerk. Complete the Utah Triple Crown this summer (8 mile swim in Great Salt Lake, 7 mile swim in Bear Lake, 10 mile swim at Deer Creek Reservoir).

								<div class="name">Coach Gavin Woods</div>
								Growing up in Utah, sports and exercise have always been part of Gavin's life. After high school, his interest in the human body and more specifically the response it has to exercise led him to the University of Utah where he earned his degree in Exercise Sports Science.  While attending college, he spent a few years working in a Physical Therapy clinic to further his knowledge of how to rehabilitate and condition the human body. One of his main responsibilities while working in the P.T. clinic was to condition the Utah Grizzlies hockey players who needed to get back to playing condition following an injury or surgery. While Gavin learned a lot from working with clients in the clinic, one thing that really stuck with him was the change he noticed in their confidence and attitude following consistent exercise.<br><br>

								Gavin's primary source for exercise came from attending a big box gym which he enjoyed but with each passing month, it became more and more monotonous for him. As the big box gym routine became less interesting, he set out to find new forms of exercise. He took up road biking in 2011 which he still enjoys to this day but Gavin knew he found something special when he began CrossFit in April 2013. Over the next 7 months, his interest kept growing and in November of the same year he earned his Level 1 Certification and has been coaching at SpearHead ever since.  Gavin has developed a passion for CrossFit for a few reasons; One is because everyone can do it and all CrossFit movements can be scaled to your personal needs and wants. He has stated that "Every day I get to watch as people work towards and achieve individual goals." Another reason he enjoys it is because he feels "lucky to be part of something that brings people joy and a sense of accomplishment."  Last but not least, Gavin enjoys CrossFit because "It is an excellent source of exercise and training, but it also offers something greater. It becomes a place where you give and receive support and encouragement in both exercise and life."

								<div class="name">Coach Alayzain (Zain) Rizavi</div>
								Greetings and fist bumps! My name is Alayzain Rizavi. I was born in Provo, UT to the most kind and selfless parents in the world, along with two older brothers. I was raised in the fun-loving city of Alpine, UT. I graduated from Lone Peak High School and am currently at the University of Utah. From my freshman to my junior year, I played on the University of Utah Rugby Team, playing positions such as inside/outside center, flanker and hook. I am now 22 years old and finishing up my bachelors degree at the University of Utah, majoring in Health, Society and Policy and minoring in the study of nutrition.<br><br>

								I stumbled upon CrossFit SpearHead during my Sophomore year at the University. Our Rugby team had the opportunity to train at SpearHead, and after my first workout, I was hooked! Coach Dallin and Caryln Frampton designed "fun" workouts for my team and I fell in love.<br><br>

								CrossFit's prescription is far more than a temporary fix, it lasts a lifetime. There are numerous prescriptions and methodologies that make CrossFit SpearHead so great, including the community, the shared love of fitness and the unwavering pursuit of excellence. CrossFit SpearHead is a family; It has been said time and time again that the moment you walk through our doors, it is a different feeling. CrossFit SpearHead has a community that is genuinely invested in the self-improvement of every athlete. Our happiness comes from the successes of our athletes reaching small goals within the gym and crushing even bigger ones in their everyday life!

								Hello, SpearHead Community! My name is Carlyn Frampton, Co-Owner of CrossFit SpearHead with my husband, Dallin Frampton. I am an obsessed CrossFitter, a recreational runner, mountain biker and rock climber and a loving daughter, wife and coach.<br><br>

								I am a resident of Holladay, Utah and absolutely love everything about my life. I have a loving Husband, amazing family members, an incredible job and a supportive community around me in everything that I do. What could be better than that, right?!<br><br>

								Dallin and I met back in 2011 after he took me on a midnight Millcreek Canyon/Pipeline trail run as our first date. We dated for a few years before we were engaged and soon to be married. Quickly, I was immersed in his life that included working for CrossFit Corporate in Kenya-based philanthropic efforts as well as the crazy thought of opening a CrossFit gym. The rest is history, obviously, and because we both loved to exercise, we decided to open the doors of CrossFit SpearHead in 2013 on the premise that helping other people achieve their goals, both in and out of the gym, is the single most important role any gym owner can play.<br><br>

								I have now been CrossFitting competitively since 2012 on an elite-level and always look for opportunities to further my competitive edge through both local and Open-style competitions. Competing at Regionals has always been a dream of mine and I can’t wait to get there this year! I have completed the Wasatch Back Ragnar relay multiple times, competed in dozens of half marathon races as well as raced in a handful of road bike events.<br><br>

								I couldn’t run the gym without Dallin and Dallin could DEFINITELY not run the gym without me! We both play such an integral part in ensuring every one of our clients have a second-to-none experience and you can absolutely bet that the next time you are working out with me, I will be cheering you on until I am blue in the face! I love everything that SpearHead stands for and I can’t wait to be your Coach!
