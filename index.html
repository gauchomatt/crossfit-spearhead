								<div class="name">Coach Dallin Frampton</div>
								As a resident of Holladay, Utah, Dallin, and his beautiful wife, Carlyn, are the Owners of CrossFit SpearHead. Dallin is an avid runner, mountain biker, rock climber, triathlete, mountaineer, skier, surfer and adventurer. He has participated in 2 marathons and a handful of triathlons, 2 of which he got 1st and 2nd place in his age group. He has also run the Wasatch Back relay four different times, competed in 12 half marathons and ridden the White rim trail 4 different times, 3 of the attempts were under 16 hours. When he was training to tryout for the USA amateur triathlon team in 2009, Dallin was introduced to CrossFit and began coaching athletes just 18 months later. Not only does he enjoy the competent and measurable aspect of CrossFit, but Dallin also has an amazing passion for his athletes and the completion of their goals through fitness, nutrition and life.<br><br>

								After graduating in 2008, he raised over $10,000 to build a school in the village of Dzivani, just outside of Mombasa, Kenya. After he received funding from CrossFit Headquarters to build another school, Coach Greg Glassman brought him on board to work for CrossFit HQ staff and Dallin is now Project Lead on this effort to build schools, water cisterns, desks and the like in rural Kenya, and also oversees all of the philanthropic work CrossFit HQ takes part in. Besides letting his adrenaline lead him through life, he also loves music and has been playing guitar for over 9 years.<br><br>

								During the Fall months of 2011, Dallin was able to meet the woman of his dreams and in June 2013, he was married to his beautiful and amazing bride, Carlyn Frampton, and they now are able to run a gym full of passionate, spirited people that they love coaching every single day. Dallin is so grateful to have such a hard-working and spirited elite-athlete like Carlyn supporting him in everything he does, especially when it comes to running the gym!

								<div class="name">Coach Carlyn Frampton</div>
								Hello, SpearHead Community! My name is Carlyn Frampton, Co-Owner of CrossFit SpearHead with my husband, Dallin Frampton. I am an obsessed CrossFitter, a recreational runner, mountain biker and rock climber and a loving daughter, wife and coach.<br><br>

								I am a resident of Holladay, Utah and absolutely love everything about my life. I have a loving Husband, amazing family members, an incredible job and a supportive community around me in everything that I do. What could be better than that, right?!<br><br>

								Dallin and I met back in 2011 after he took me on a midnight Millcreek Canyon/Pipeline trail run as our first date. We dated for a few years before we were engaged and soon to be married. Quickly, I was immersed in his life that included working for CrossFit Corporate in Kenya-based philanthropic efforts as well as the crazy thought of opening a CrossFit gym. The rest is history, obviously, and because we both loved to exercise, we decided to open the doors of CrossFit SpearHead in 2013 on the premise that helping other people achieve their goals, both in and out of the gym, is the single most important role any gym owner can play.<br><br>

								I have now been CrossFitting competitively since 2012 on an elite-level and always look for opportunities to further my competitive edge through both local and Open-style competitions. Competing at Regionals has always been a dream of mine and I can’t wait to get there this year! I have completed the Wasatch Back Ragnar relay multiple times, competed in dozens of half marathon races as well as raced in a handful of road bike events.<br><br>

								I couldn’t run the gym without Dallin and Dallin could DEFINITELY not run the gym without me! We both play such an integral part in ensuring every one of our clients have a second-to-none experience and you can absolutely bet that the next time you are working out with me, I will be cheering you on until I am blue in the face! I love everything that SpearHead stands for and I can’t wait to be your Coach!

								<div class="name">Coach Scot Neff</div>
								Scot Neff is thrilled and honored to be a coach at CrossFit Spearhead. He has been a Salt Lake resident most of his life and is currently the Director of Zermatt Resort’s Sports Academy. In 2015, Scot graduated with his Masters of Business Administration with an emphasis in Entrepreneurship at Westminster College. In 2011 he graduated with his Bachelors in Economics from the University of Utah. During his undergraduate, Scot earned a spot on the A side roster of the U of U’s Rugby team where he learned discipline, grit, and leadership skills. He is happily married to the love of his life and currently has two amazing boys that brighten their lives daily.  Scot is an avid outdoorsman and loves spending time fly fishing, skiing, hiking, diving, snowmobiling, horseback riding, and hunting.<br><br>

								Due to a skiing accident, Scot had a crippling back injury. He felt like he could no longer do the things he loved. He was always in pain, unsure of himself, and felt helpless. After trying just about every type of exercise and fitness to aid Scot’s recovery, he had a rugby teammate tell him to try CrossFit. That was in October of 2013 and today he is stronger, faster, fitter, and overall happier than he has ever been before.<br><br>

								Coming from someone who at one point couldn’t sit through a movie, ride in a car, jump, or tie his own shoes, Scot is a true believer in CrossFit. The functional movement and fitness behind CrossFit strengthens the human body in ways one cannot comprehend. It is all about taking things slow, and growing one step at a time. There is something beautiful about doing hard things, CrossFit will make a person do just that. As a coach, Scot’s strengths are pushing athletes to the next level and helping them get through their own ‘pain caves’. He believes that by pushing through self-doubt and weakness the output will be positive for both body and mind. If one hasn’t tried CrossFit Spearhead, do it! It will change all facets of life for good.

								Luke was born and raised in Salt Lake City  only a few blocks away from the gym. He grew up playing team sports such as football, lacrosse and rugby but as he grew he gravitated more toward individual sports and really fell in love with the martial arts in 2009. Since then he has competed in a number of amateur level grappling tournaments and mixed martial arts fights. He also currently serves in the US Army reserve and loves taking care of his soldiers and helping his squad accomplish their missions. If Luke were to have a mission statement it would be as follows; "stack the odds in your favor to live a long and healthy life."" Crossfit teaches, and Luke affirms that physical strength and conditioning are essential to living long and enjoying life.

								<div class="name">Coach Jonny Sandberg</div>
								Hello! Short introduction on me. I’m a local of the Salt Lake Valley. I’m very diverse in my hobbies and activities and love to surround myself with different groups of people. Specifically I enjoy boating, climbing, golfing, playing soccer, vacationing near beaches and working out.<br><br>

								I’ve always been a big fan of working out. When I was about 7 or 8 years old I joined a soccer team. In Jr. High I held one of the school records for the fastest mile. Upon entering my freshman year at high school I joined the high school soccer team and went into the post season playoffs. To say that I enjoy being part of a team would be a gross understatement. I thrive off of this team-type atmosphere which coincidentally CrossFit SpearHead has.<br><br>

								I was fortunate enough to join just before the CrossFit Open started in 2016. After each of those workouts, my muscles hurt so bad that I could hardly move for a week! I hadn’t felt this type of pain since conditioning with the high school soccer team. Shortly after I was approached by the owners, Dallin and Carlyn, and offered an opportunity to begin coaching. I leapt at the opportunity! It was a goal many years prior to help others reach their fitness goals.<br><br>

								The culture, people, and overall atmosphere is infectious. The community builds each member to be a better version of themselves. Seeing each member push past barriers of inadequacy and reach their potential is both fulfilling and rewarding. Come see the difference!

								<div class="name">Coach Summer Andrus</div>
								I fell in love with the mountains of Salt Lake when I moved out here from St. Louis to attend the University of Utah. I took up rock climbing, river rafting, trail and road running, hiking, backpacking and eventually swimming, and road and mountain biking. In 2004 I discovered triathlons and began competing in sprint, olympic, half, and eventually full Ironman distances. In 2008 I started coaching triathlon training, running, swimming, and spin courses at the University of Utah for the Exercise &amp; Sports Science department. I loved helping students achieve their goals, overcome challenges, try new things and find themselves doing things they never thought they could do. There’s a rush that comes with being a part of that journey. I also spent a few years working with spinal cord injury (SCI) patients at the University of Utah Rehabilitation center. While most of my duties were administrative, I had the absolute joy and pleasure of working with SCI outpatients in the TRAILS (Therapeutic Recreation &amp; Independent Life Styles) program. With adaptive equipment we helped people learn how to cross-country ski, downhill ski, kayak, handcycle, and participate in marathon handcycle divisions with what body and muscular function remained post-injury. I’ve also spent time working with teenagers including teaching high school health, coordinating and teaching in a secondary education program for teenagers struggling with mental illnesses, and earning my Master’s in Public Health with an emphasis in health communications and adolescent health. I can’t think of a better fit for the rollercoaster of teenage life than a CrossFit program and I’m excited to be a part of it.<br><br>

								I’m the lucky wife to a loving husband, a mother to two incredible boys, an outdoor enthusiast, a life long learner, a seeker of good, a great cook, a Mandarin speaker, an athlete, and, dare I say, a donut lover. After having kids and finding I no longer had ample hours to maintain my triathlon training, CrossFit helped restore the athlete in me and keeps me on a road to the highest level of general fitness I can achieve, an ongoing journey where today I can be better than yesterday. Plus, it’s just fun! And you can’t beat the SpearHead community.

								I began working out the first time that leg warmers were cool ;) when the heaviest thing a girl should pick up was a 5lb hand weight. I’ve seen every work out trend (and enjoyed most all of them!) including step aerobics, distance running, spin, Triathlon training, yoga, TRX... basically you name it I’ve tried it. After working many years to ‘get in shape’ or ‘stay in shape’ I’ve learned so many great things about not only fitness, but about the amazing way our body is designed to move and the responsibility we each have to learn how to keep it moving without pain over long periods of time.<br><br>

								The best way to do this is with a little daily effort and a little self discipline. And of course, the education to know what to do and when.<br><br>

								In 2013 I began to use CrossFit as my daily workout, and soon after discovered that Mobility, which is movement that repairs muscle fibers and prepares your body to move more comfortably, makes working out not only more enjoyable, but much more sustainable.  This, for me, was like the missing link of fitness! I’ve been a mobility junky ever since, and have sought out any opportunity to learn about this aspect of fitness and how to share it with others.<br><br>

								In January of 2015 I completed the mobility course with CrossFit HQ, and in November 2015 became a level 1 CrossFit coach. During the first half of 2016 I worked to obtain a 200 hour yoga teacher training certificate, which has served to round out my passion for mobility and movement.<br><br>

								When not enjoying the gym I am working to enjoy my family and serve in my church. I love working out with and being a partner to my husband John. Together we enjoy (?) the chaos of raising 6 children, 1 dog and 9 chickens. In any moments to spare we love serving in the refugee community and spending time with amazing people like those at CrossFit Spearhead.
